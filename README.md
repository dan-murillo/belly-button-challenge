# Belly button biodiversity *(Challenge 14)*

This repository contains a mini-project in which I created an [**interactive dashboard**](https://dan-murillo.github.io/belly-button-challenge/index.html) that depicts the data of a study about the human belly button microbe biodiversity.

## Repository description

In 2012, Hulcr et al. published their first scientific research-based article titled *A Jungle in There: Bacteria in Belly Buttons are Highly Diverse, but Predictable*. They found that, although predicting exactly what bacteria and archaea live in the navel is insanely difficult, it is easy to predict what kind of species usually live in the human navel and what kind are rarely found there. They detected over 2300 species in people in the US, but saw on average 67 bacterial phylotypes per belly button. Also, they discovered that this part of the body is usually dominated by only a few groups of organisms.

This repository contains an interactive dashboard of the open access data of that interesting research article. The data were downloaded from The Public Science Lab website by the North Carolina State University, and the samples collected for the study were put in a JSON file for easier handling.

An interactive dashboard of the JSON file was created to let users see the "operational taxonomic units" (OTUs; a small handful of microbial species, which genomes were at least 97% similar) of 152 different anonymous people.

You will also find the HTML and JS code of the dashboard in this repository.

### The *index.html* file:

It contains the HTML code of the dashboard.
